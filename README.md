# Telegram Bot Practical
# Si-Bone Chatbot with SpaCy Integration

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
Many chatbots are either too simple (keyword-based) or too complex (pure NLP without clear flow).  
This project addresses the need for a **hybrid chatbot** that combines:
- **Simple quick replies** for casual conversation.
- **Stateful conversation** using SpaCy NLP for guided interactions.

It is designed as a Telegram bot that:
- Responds to simple phrases like "hello" or "how are you".
- Can enter a conversation mode (via `/startconv`) where it analyzes the text for nouns (and can be extended to more NLP features).
- Supports `/help` and `/cancel` for usability.
